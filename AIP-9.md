[CrispyWhales](https://crispywhales.com) is a company to build a web service [BananaClips](https://bananaclips.net) to buy and sell short clips.

## Description
A short clip is a short video that is needed in-between switching scenes of the main video, such as passing people, landscape, animation, etc. It is used in various fields such as advertising, movies, series, and so on.

[BananaClips](https://bananaclips.net) is a web service to provide an O2O marketplace to purchase these short clips which are uploaded by users. In addition, [BananaClips](https://bananaclips.net) gives a feature to manage copyrights of uploaders; creators, providers, etc., based on a blockchain technology.

### Digital Video Watermark
A background system of [BananaClips](https://bananaclips.net) generates a copyright transaction on the blockchain when a user uploads a short clip via our service. The transaction contains copyrights and a watermark of the short clip with metadata such as a resolution, rotation, geolocation, device information, and so on. The watermark is a unique and steganographic value generated by our background AI system.

Therefore, all buyers will download this watermarked short clip after purchasing. And the uploader can request and/or detect whether a used short clip violates the uploader's copyrights anytime and anywhere through the blockchain.

### Digital Video Fingerprint
While the copyrights can be fickle by a contract between uploader and downloader, the inherited contract from the copyrights should be protected by a credible 3rd-party or system. This credible party can be replaced by the blockchain due to the reliability of the blockchain as one of the core feature.

[BananaClips](https://bananaclips.net) also provides a contract management system for uploaders and downloads through the blockchain. The system generates a new transaction that contains the context of the contract and fingerprint to verify and authorize the contract.

Accordingly, users can request and/or claim their rights to the downloaders when they find each violated cases.

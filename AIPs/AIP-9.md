[Crispy Whales](https://crispywhales.com) is a company to build a web service [Banana Clips](https://bananaclips.net) to buy and sell short clips.

## Description
A short clip is a short video that is needed in-between switching scenes of the main video, such as passing people, landscape, animation, etc. It is used in various fields such as advertising, movies, series, and so on.

[Banana Clips](https://bananaclips.net) is a web service to provide an O2O marketplace to purchase these short clips which are uploaded by users developsed and serviced by [Crispy Whales](https://crispywhales.com). In addition, [Banana Clips](https://bananaclips.net) gives a feature to manage copyrights of uploaders; creators, providers, etc., based on a blockchain technology.

### Digital Video Watermark
A background system of [Banana Clips](https://bananaclips.net) generates a copyright transaction on the blockchain when a user uploads a short clip via our service. The transaction contains copyrights and a watermark of the short clip with metadata such as a resolution, rotation, geolocation, device information, and so on. The watermark is a unique and steganographic value generated by our background system after analyzing the uploaded video via our background AI system.

Therefore, all buyers will download this watermarked short clip after purchasing. And the uploader can request and/or detect whether a used short clip violates the uploader's copyrights anytime and anywhere through the blockchain.

### Digital Video Fingerprint
While the copyrights can be fickle by a contract between uploader and downloader, the inherited contract from the copyrights should be protected by a credible 3rd-party or system. This credible party can be replaced by the blockchain due to the reliability of the blockchain as one of the core feature.

[Banana Clips](https://bananaclips.net) also provides a contract management system for uploaders and downloads through the blockchain. The system generates a new transaction that contains the context of the contract and fingerprint to verify and authorize the contract.

Accordingly, users can request and/or claim their rights to the downloaders when they find each violated cases.


## Proposal
[Banana Clips](https://bananaclipse.net) proposes using AERGO as the blockchain mentioned above.

The [Banana Clips](https://bananaclipse.net) service will generate and transmit transactions for the digital watermarks from uploaded short videos on the service and the digitally fingerprinted contracts between buyers and sellers of the service on the AERGO mainnet.

One final step ... We hope to contribute to AERGO's NTF protocol through the [Banana Clips](https://bananaclips.net) marketplace transparent and opened for all users can use.
